# Project-two

PROPOSAL:

We’re looking to provide data to display the economic effect of covid on a major league sport, in this case, the MLB.  The timeline will be from 2019-2021 which will present each team’s league standing before, during, and through the recovery of 2020.  In a review of the data, we will be able to depict which teams were hit the hardest and what effect it had on players' performance if any.  It would also be of use to any sports enthusiast who would like to crunch stats and see what contributed to each team’s success in each of the years.


Team Members:
Osamu Adler,
Sergio Basurto,
Michael Diaz,
Anthony Palacios
